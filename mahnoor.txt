What is the extension of a prolog Knowledge Base?
Answer:Knowledge base and prolog programming is all about writing knowledge bases and prolog program simply are kanowlegde base.
How to load a knowledge base in prolog
Answer:A collection of facts and rules is called a knowledge base (or a database) and Prolog programming is all about writing knowledge bases. That is, Prolog programs simply are knowledge bases, collections of facts and rules which describe some collection of relationships that we find interesting

What is an atom?

What is a term?

A constant, which can be either an atom or a number.
A variable.
A compound term.
What is functor?

What are complex terms?
Answer:The number of arguments that a complex term has is called its arity.
What is predicate?
Answer:The predicate name is a Prolog atom. ... A predicate with name Pred and N arguments is denoted by Pred/N, which is called a predicate indicator. N is called the arity of the predicate. A predicate is defined by a collection of clauses. A clause is either a rule or a fact
What is arity of predicate?
Answer:The arity of a relation (or predicate) is the dimension of the domain in the corresponding Cartesian product. (A function of arity n thus has arity n+1 considered as a relation.) The term springs from words like unary, binary, ternary, etc. ... In logic and philosophy, arity is also called adicity and degree.
What is unification?
Answer:The way in which Prolog matches two terms is called unification. ... The unification algorithm in Prolog is roughly this: df:un Given two terms and which are to be unified: If and are constants (i.e. atoms or numbers) then if they are the same succeed.
